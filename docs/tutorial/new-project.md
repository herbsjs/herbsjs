## Introduction to Herbs

Herbs helps you to build backend applications faster and given more value for your domain and business logic. You can found more about in [What's Herbs?](/docs)

If you don't want to see a step-by-step tutorial but an application running with herbs, you can visit our [Getting Started](/docs/introduction/getting-started) section.

To help in the setup process, Herbs has the [`herbs-cli`](https://github.com/herbsjs/herbs-cli) which start up a new project scaffolding.

In this tutorial we are going to walk through all the features from Herbs, building an User application.

## What to Expect

- 2 entities
- 3 use cases
- Database access and Repositories
- Graph QL Types, Mutations and Queries
- Documentation with Herbs Shelf

## Requirements

- You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed into your machine with LTS version

## Project Setup

You will see how to use this tutorial with hebs-cli or manually. But we strongly recommend to use our [`herbs-cli`](https://github.com/herbsjs/herbs-cli)

### With herbs-cli

1. Install [`herbs-cli`](https://github.com/herbsjs/herbs-cli) globally:
