Herbs Shelf is a self-generated documentation based on your use cases and entities from your domain.

### Installing
```
  npm install @herbsjs/herbsshelf
```

### Using 

To use Herbs Shelf, all you have to do is inform a list of use cases and it will return a string containing the HTML with the generated documentation.

The quickest way to use the herbs shelf is to create a rest route in your api and expose the documentation generated by the shelf.

Consider a file called _uclist.js with this inside
```javascript
module.exports = (injection) => {
    return [
        { usecase: require('./myUseCaseFile').myUseCaseName(injection), tags: { group: 'GroupOne' } },
        { usecase: require('./myUseCase2File').myUseCase2Name(injection), tags: { group: 'GroupOne' } },
        { usecase: require('./myUseCase3File').myUseCase3Name(injection), tags: { group: 'GroupTwo' } },
    ]
}
```

In your app or server file, import the shelf dependecy and the list of usecases

```javascript
const usecases = require('../../domain/usecases/_uclist')
const renderShelfHTML = require('@herbsjs/herbsshelf')
```

And call the shelf into you prefered rest route

```javascript
 this.app.get('/herbsshelf', (req, res, next) => {
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html')
      const shelf = renderShelfHTML(usecases())
      res.write(shelf)
      res.end()
 }

```
