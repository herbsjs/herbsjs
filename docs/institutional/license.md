We hope to see Herbs become the good code standard everywhere. When we saw how much Herbs improved developer experience and productivity internally, we wanted to share those gains. After all, if Herbs can create order in an engineering environment as open and diverse as ours, then we're pretty sure it can create order (and boost productivity) anywhere.
