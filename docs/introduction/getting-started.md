We created an example repository, completely full stack so you can see the applicability of Herbs in a project closer to the real world.

Within this repository, you will find a front-end application, made in react consuming a back-end application, using herbsJS, the API is made in graphQL

So, you can start with HerbJS, taking a look at the [sample repository](https://github.com/herbsjs/todolist-on-herbs), or follow this documentation to get more knowledge of how to use herbsJS

## Forum & Discussions

We have a forum, where we have discussions, questions and doubts about the world around herbsJS. Any question, you can communicate with the community through this link: [Herbs Forum](https://github.com/herbsjs/forum)


## TO DO list on Herbs

This is a example on how to build a application using [Herbs](https://github.com/herbsjs).
